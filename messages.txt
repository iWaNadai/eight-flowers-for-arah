//I love you with all my heart.
//Ikaw ang pahinga.
//My day becomes sweeter when I think of you.
//I will long for you like the how rain longs for the ground.
//You are the sweet sugar that my bitter coffee needs.
//With you, every moment is a sweet memory in the making.
//Loving you is like breathingâ€”effortless and essential.
//In your smile, I see something more beautiful than stars.
